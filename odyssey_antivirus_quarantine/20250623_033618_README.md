# Educational Virus and Antivirus Project

## 🎓 Academic Cybersecurity Exercise
**National Teachers College - Code vs. Code Project**

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: This is an educational project for academic purposes only. Must be executed in virtual machines or isolated sandbox environments.

## 📋 Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Virtual Machine (VirtualBox, VMware, etc.)
- Git (optional, for version control)

### Required Python Libraries
All required libraries are part of Python standard library:
- `tkinter` (for GUI)
- `os`, `sys`, `json`, `time`
- `hashlib`, `pathlib`, `datetime`
- `shutil`, `fnmatch`, `platform`

## 🚀 Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Environment Setup

1. **Create Virtual Machine**
   ```bash
   # Recommended: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or Windows 10
   # Allocate at least 2GB RAM and 20GB disk space
   ```

2. **Download Project Files**
   ```bash
   # Create project directory
   mkdir virus_project
   cd virus_project
   
   # Download the Python files:
   # - educational_virus.py
   # - educational_antivirus.py
   ```

3. **Verify Python Installation**
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   # Should show Python 3.7 or higher
   ```

### Step 2: File Organization
```

├── educational_virus.py
├── educational_antivirus.py
├── README.md
└── (virus_test_area/ - will be created automatically)
```

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Project

### Phase 1: Educational Virus Execution

1. **Navigate to project directory**
   ```bash
   cd virus_project
   ```

2. **Run the educational virus**
   ```bash
   python3 educational_virus.py
   ```

3. **Follow the prompts**
   - Accept educational consent dialog
   - Confirm virtual machine environment
   - Observe virus behaviors

**Expected Results:**
- Creation of `virus_test_area/` directory
- File duplication with `_VIRUS_COPY` suffix
- Educational popup messages
- Activity log generation (`virus_activity.log`)
- Encrypted payload creation

### Phase 2: Antivirus Detection and Removal

1. **Run the antivirus tool**
   ```bash
   python3 educational_antivirus.py
   ```

2. **Use the GUI interface**
   - Click "Start System Scan"
   - Review detected threats
   - Click "Remove Detected Viruses"
   - Verify system cleanup

**Expected Results:**
- Detection of virus signatures
- Encrypted payload analysis
- Threat quarantine/removal
- System restoration

- Automatic if `tkinter` is available
- User-friendly interface
- Real-time scan results
- Interactive threat removal

### Command Line Mode
- Fallback if GUI unavailable
- Text-based interaction
- Complete functionality
- Suitable for headless systems

## 🔍 Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Virus Behavior
1. Run virus → Observe file duplication
2. Run antivirus → Verify detection
3. Remove threats → Confirm cleanup

### Scenario 2: Encryption Analysis
1. Run virus → Check encrypted payload
2. Run antivirus → View decryption process
3. Analyze cryptographic techniques used

### Scenario 3: System Restoration
1. Run virus → Note system changes
2. Run antivirus with removal → Verify restoration
3. Confirm original file integrity

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Permission Errors**
   ```bash
   # Ensure write permissions
   chmod +x educational_virus.py
   chmod +x educational_antivirus.py
   ```

2. **GUI Not Available**
   ```bash
   # Install tkinter if missing (Ubuntu/Debian)
   sudo apt-get install python3-tk
   
   # The program will automatically fall back to CLI mode
   ```

3. **Virtual Machine Detection Fails**
   - Type `EDUCATIONAL_OVERRIDE` when prompted
   - Ensure you're in a safe, isolated environment
   - Contact instructor if issues persist

4. **Module Import Errors**
   ```bash
   # All modules are standard library - check Python version
   python3 --version
   ```
